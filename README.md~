# Udacity-MLND

This repository contains code I implemented as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. Currently, it contains the following projects:

* _Finding Donors for CharityML_: We compare different classifiers to find the most probable donors for a fictitious charity organization. It turns out that this task can best be solved with the use of a _Random Forest_ classifier. We also evaluate the available features and find that only a small subset of the feature set allows us to achieve a high F-Score. However, as the classifier trained on the whole data set performs slightly better and is only slighty slower, we will use the complete data set for performing predictions.

# Udacity-MLND

This repository contains code I implemented as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. Currently, it contains the following projects:

* _Finding Donors for CharityML_: We compare different classifiers to find the most probable donors for a fictitious charity organization. It turns out that this task can best be solved with the use of a _Random Forest_ classifier. We also evaluate the available features and find that only a small subset of the feature set allows us to achieve a high F-Score. However, as the classifier trained on the whole data set performs slightly better and is only slighty slower in absolute terms, we will use the complete data set for performing predictions.
* _Customer Segments_: Customers from a wholesale distributor are being analyzed. Different clusters of customer types can be identified with the use of a Gaussian Mixture Model. With this knowledge, it's possible to identify opportunities to increase revenue.
